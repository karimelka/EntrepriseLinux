# Ansible Skeleton

An opinionated skeleton for an Ansible project with a development environment
powered by Vagrant. This should work on Linux, MacOS *and* Windows.

The goal of this skeleton is having an Ansible setup that works without modification both in the development environment (Vagrant + VirtualBox) and production. Therefore, the Ansible project is set up according to their [best practices](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_best_practices.html). This also implies the possibility of a multi-VM Vagrant setup.

Prerequisites on the VirtualBox host system:

* VirtualBox (>= 4.3.x)
* Vagrant (>= 1.6.x)
* Ruby (>= 2.0.0)
* Git (>= 1.9.x) and for Windows hosts also Git Bash

## Getting started

First, modify the `Vagrantfile` to select your favourite base box. I use a CentOS 7 base box, based on [Mischa Taylor's Packer template](https://github.com/box-cutter/centos-vm).

The `ansible/` directory contains the Ansible configuration, and should at least contain the standard `site.yml`.

The `vagrant_hosts.yml` file specifies the boxen that are controlled by `Vagrantfile`. You should at least specify a `name:` and `ip:` for each. A host-only adapter is created and the given IP assigned to that interface. Other optional settings that can be specified:

* `netmask`: by default, the network mask is `255.255.255.0`. If you want another one, it should be specified.
* `mac`: The MAC address to be assigned to the NIC. Several notations are accepted, including "Linux-style" (`00:11:22:33:44:55`) and "Windows-style" (`00-11-22-33-44-55`). The separator characters can be omitted altogether (`001122334455`).
* `intnet`: If set to `true`, the network interface will be attached to an internal network rather than a host-only adapter.
* `auto_config`: If set to `false`, Vagrant will not attempt to configure the network interface.

For now, two hosts are defined: `srv001` and `srv002`. If you want to add new box(en), you should edit the following files:

* `vagrant_hosts.yml` so a Vagrant box is created. A few examples that also illustrate the optional settings.

```yaml
- name: srv003
  ip: 192.168.56.13
  auto_config: false

- name: srv004
  ip: 172.16.0.5
  netmask: 255.255.0.0
  intnet: true

- name: srv005
  ip: 192.168.56.14
  mac: "00:03:DE:AD:BE:EF"
```

* `ansible/inventory_dev`. If your host system is Windows, this is the Ansible inventory file for your development environment. Linux and Mac hosts will use Vagrant's automatically generated inventory file in `.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory`.
* `site.yml` to assign roles to your boxen.

## Running tests with BATS

There's a discussion on whether Unit tests are necessary for Ansible. Indeed, with its declarative nature, Ansible largely takes away the need to check for certain things independently from the playbook definitions. For a bit more background, be sure to read through [this discussion unit testing for Ansible](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-project/7VhqDDtf6Js) on Google groups.

However, it is my opinion that playbooks don't cover everything (e.g. whether a config file generated from a template has the expected contents, given the values of variables used). I value some form of testing, independent of the configuration management system. I'm a fan of the [Bash Automated Testing System (BATS)](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats). It's basically an extension of Bash, so very accessible for any Unix-oriented system administrator. This skeleton supports BATS tests.

Put your BATS test scripts in the `test/` directory and they will become available on your guest VMs as a synced folder, mounted in `/vagrant/test`. Scripts that you want to run on each host should be stored in the `test/` directory itself, scripts for individual hosts should be stored in subdirectories with the same name as the host.

The script `runbats.sh`, when run inside the VM, will install BATS if needed and execute all test scripts for that host.
